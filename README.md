# wordSearch

This applications is developed in the context of my Postdoctoral interview with Queen's University.
It is written in Java and in order to execute it type:

	$ javac wordSearch.java

and

	$ java wordSearch wordToSearchFor

Note that the applications can accepted both lower or upper case letter as a command-line option.
An array of letters is give by default (found in the root direcotry of this folder i.e., array2D.txt).
However, if you wish to use a different one just pass the path of the new file as the second command line argument.
